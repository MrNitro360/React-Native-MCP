TITLE: Made a React Native helper for Claude that actually knows what it's talking about

POST:

Hey everyone!

So I got tired of googling React Native stuff every 5 minutes and decided to do something about it. I built this thing that makes Claude actually useful for RN development.

Basically, you can now ask Claude real React Native questions and get answers that don't suck:

"Why is my FlatList so damn slow?"
"How do I structure this app without it turning into spaghetti?"
"This thing crashes on iOS but works fine on Android, what gives?"

It can look at your components and tell you what you're doing wrong, suggest better ways to handle performance, and just generally act like that senior dev who actually knows React Native.

The cool part is it works from anywhere - you don't have to open some special app or anything. Just type your question in the terminal and get a real answer instead of "have you tried turning it off and on again?"

I made it because honestly, the React Native docs are scattered and Stack Overflow is hit or miss. This thing actually knows the current best practices and won't suggest stuff from 2018 that doesn't work anymore.

It's free and open source if anyone wants to check it out or make it better:

Anyone else building stuff like this? Would love to see what other developer tools people are working on.

TITLE: Built a React Native assistant for Claude that doesn't give terrible advice

POST:

Made a tool that makes Claude actually helpful for React Native development instead of just making stuff up.

Now I can ask "why is my app so slow?" and get real answers instead of generic AI nonsense. It knows about React Native performance, can review components, and helps with iOS/Android specific issues.

Works from terminal - just ask questions and get answers that actually make sense.

Sick of googling the same RN problems over and over, so I made this. It's based on the official docs and current best practices.

Anyone else tired of AI giving outdated React Native advice?
