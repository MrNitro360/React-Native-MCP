### Installation

#### ‚ö° Automated Installation (Recommended)

The server is automatically published to npm with every update. Get the latest version instantly:

```bash
# Install the latest version
npm install -g @mrnitro360/react-native-mcp-guide

# Add to Claude CLI
claude mcp add react-native-guide npx @mrnitro360/react-native-mcp-guide
```

#### üîÑ Easy Updates

Stay current with the latest features and improvements:

```bash
# Update to latest version
npm update -g @mrnitro360/react-native-mcp-guide

# Remove and re-add to Claude CLI to use latest version
claude mcp remove react-native-guide
claude mcp add react-native-guide npx @mrnitro360/react-native-mcp-guide
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è Development Installation (From Source)
