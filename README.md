## üí° Usage Examples

### Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

```bash
# Full project analysis (security, performance, quality, accessibility)
claude "analyze_codebase_comprehensive"

# Focus on specific areas
claude "analyze_codebase_comprehensive focusing on security and deprecated_features"

# Performance-only analysis
claude "analyze_codebase_performance"

# Single component analysis (or entire codebase if no code provided)
claude "analyze_component"
```

### Real-World Examples

```bash
# Security audit
"Scan my React Native project for security vulnerabilities"

# Performance optimization
"Analyze my app for performance bottlenecks and memory leaks"

# Code quality assessment  
"Review my codebase for refactoring opportunities and best practices"

# Accessibility compliance
"Check my app for accessibility issues and recommendations"

# Dependency management
"Audit my packages for outdated or deprecated dependencies"
```

### With Claude CLI

```bash
# Start interactive session
claude

# Example queries:
# "Analyze this React Native component for performance issues"
# "What's the best architecture for a React Native e-commerce app?"  
# "How do I optimize a FlatList with 10,000+ items?"
# "Debug this navigation crash on iOS"
```

### With Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
