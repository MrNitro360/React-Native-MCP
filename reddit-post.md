**🚀 Built a React Native MCP Server for Claude - Get Expert RN Guidance Anywhere!**

Hey React Native devs! 👋

I just finished building and open-sourcing a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that brings React Native expertise directly to Claude CLI. Now you can get expert React Native guidance from anywhere in your terminal!

**🔥 What it does:**
- **Component Analysis** - Review your RN components for best practices
- **Performance Optimization** - Get specific recommendations for your app
- **Architecture Advice** - Design guidance for scalable React Native apps  
- **Debugging Help** - Platform-specific troubleshooting (iOS/Android)
- **Official Docs Integration** - Instant access to RN documentation and patterns

**⚡ Quick Setup:**
```bash
# Install globally via Claude CLI
claude config add-server react-native-guide
```

**🎯 Use Cases:**
- Code reviews with RN best practices
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Cross-platform development guidance
- Learning React Native patterns
- Architecture decisions

**🛠️ Built with:**
- TypeScript + MCP SDK 1.0.0
- Comprehensive toolset (4 analysis tools, 6 guidance prompts)
- Based on official React Native documentation

**🌟 Why I built this:**
As React Native developers, we often need quick access to best practices, performance tips, and platform-specific guidance. Instead of constantly searching docs or Stack Overflow, this MCP server brings expert knowledge directly to your development workflow.

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Has anyone else experimented with MCP servers for development workflows?

### For r/ClaudeAI:

**📱 Created an MCP Server That Brings React Native Best Practices to Claude CLI**

Fellow Claude users! 🤖

I've been experimenting with the Model Context Protocol and built something cool - a specialized MCP server for React Native development that integrates with Claude CLI.

**🎯 What it does:**
Transforms Claude into a React Native expert that can:
- Analyze your RN components and suggest improvements
- Provide performance optimization recommendations  
- Help with cross-platform development challenges
- Offer architecture guidance for scalable apps
- Debug platform-specific issues (iOS/Android)

**⚡ How it works:**
Once configured with Claude CLI, you can ask React Native questions from anywhere:
```
claude "How can I optimize this FlatList for better performance?"
claude "What's the best architecture for a React Native app with offline support?"
claude "Review this component for React Native best practices"
```

**🛠️ Technical Details:**
- Built with TypeScript + MCP SDK 1.0.0
- 4 specialized analysis tools
- 6 guidance prompt templates
- 5 documentation resource libraries
- Follows official React Native best practices

**🌟 Why MCP is awesome:**
This project really showcases how MCP can create domain-specific AI assistants. Instead of generic responses, Claude now has deep, structured knowledge about React Native development patterns, performance considerations, and platform-specific quirks.

### For r/javascript or r/programming:

**⚡ Built an MCP Server: React Native Expert Assistant for Claude CLI**

Hey developers! 👨‍💻

Just shipped an interesting project - a **Model Context Protocol server** that turns Claude into a React Native development expert. Thought you might find the approach interesting from both a React Native and AI tooling perspective.

**🎯 The Problem:**
React Native development involves a lot of platform-specific knowledge, performance considerations, and evolving best practices. Developers often spend time searching docs, Stack Overflow, or asking in forums for guidance.

**💡 The Solution:**
An MCP server that provides structured, expert-level React Native knowledge directly through Claude CLI. It's like having a senior React Native dev available 24/7 in your terminal.

**🔧 Features:**
- **Component Analysis** - Automated code review with RN best practices
- **Performance Profiling** - Optimization recommendations for your specific use case
- **Architecture Consulting** - Design patterns for scalable mobile apps
- **Cross-Platform Debugging** - Platform-specific issue resolution
- **Documentation Integration** - Instant access to official RN resources

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript + Node.js
- Model Context Protocol SDK 1.0.0
- Zod for schema validation
- Based on official React Native documentation

**🌟 Why This Matters:**
This demonstrates how MCP can create specialized AI assistants for specific domains. Instead of generic AI responses, you get expert knowledge tailored to your exact development context.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
claude "Analyze this React Native component for performance issues"
claude "What's the best state management approach for a large RN app?"
claude "Help me debug this iOS-specific crash"
```

Curious what you think about this approach to domain-specific AI tooling. Are there other development areas where specialized MCP servers would be valuable?
